# Skahal.Infrastructure.Framework.Domain
Infrastructure framework for Domain used in our games and apps.

This is a fork from a peace of https://github.com/skahal/Skahal.Infrastructure.Framework in order to split it in several small parts. Easier to maintan and easier to use.

Skahal.Infrastructure.Framework.Domain is the lib with the basic definition of a Entity and Aggregate Root.
